# Dart Compilation Experiment

Experimental test of dart compiling different type of code bases.

## Running Experiment

> go run ./experiment/main.go

## NOTICE

The code in the treatments was designed to be extra complicated to
help better test the build process.
Obviously the treatment code can be greatly simplified, improved, etc.
The goal is to test the Dart build speeds, not write good Dart code.
